#Password Generator

##Description

This weeks challenge was to familairise ourselves with the intermediate skills needed in Javascript, build on javascript fundamentals to code effectively and use javascript with the possibility of updating a page and fetching data from a remote server.

##Installation

When working on the project I came across an alternative method of inputting the data so that the output in console reflects something similar to the desired outcome. I incorperated a prompt function as the primary function for the website. I couldnt get the generate button to work so managed to 
correct this error by implementing an alternative function that does the same thing. I kept the UI/UX simple and sleek to satisfy the users comfortability and web use.
I also managed to create a function where the text could appear in the text box with a concealed password entry, although the 'login' button does not take the user anywhere for this particular challenge.

##Usage
